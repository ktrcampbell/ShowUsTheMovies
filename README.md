Goal -
Create a new application with the Movie DB API integrated. The application should have two screens as described below. We’ll be looking at your coding style, use of data structures, collections, and overall Android SDK knowledge. It’s up to you to impress us with this assignment. The list of movies can be a simple or as “fancy” as you’d like it to be. Try to have some fun.
Screen 1 -
Screen should contain a search button that reveals a text enter box and a submit button. Search the movie DB by movies using the query text entered when the user taps "submit" button. Then show a list of movies found in the same screen. When scrolled to the bottom of the list, start lazy loading next set of movies and append it to the list.
Screen 2 -
Show movie details when a list item is clicked.

Requirements -
- Use white color for action bar.
- Movies DB API doc at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies (generate a new API key for you if necessary)
